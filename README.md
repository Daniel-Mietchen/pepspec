# PEP Docs

This is the repository for the PEP specification. These docs are written using `mkdocs` and hosted on `readthedocs`. Each version has a different branch. You can view the hosted docs by version, for example, [http://pep.databio.org/en/2.0.0/](http://pep.databio.org/en/2.0.0/) for version `2.0.0`.

## Building locally

Switch to the branch you want to build and use either `mkdocs build` or `mkdocs serve` to render the docs.

## Contributing

Edit the files in the `docs` subdirectory. Please submit a PR to the appropriate branch for the version you are editing.
